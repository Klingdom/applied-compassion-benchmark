# ITERATION LOG — Compassion Benchmark

## Iteration 1 — 2026-04-14

### Selected Item
Fix 4 failing interactive tests (Backlog #1, Score: 14)

### Reason for Selection
Tests are the foundation of the improvement loop. The system was in a degraded state with 4 failing tests, blocking reliable validation of all future changes. Determinism principle: restore the ability to prove correctness before adding anything new.

### Root Cause Analysis
The 4 test failures were NOT caused by code bugs. Root cause: Playwright config had no `webServer` directive, requiring a manually-started dev server on port 3000. A stale/crashed server was returning 500 errors, causing all interactive component tests to fail.

### What Changed
- **`playwright.config.ts`**: Added `webServer` config to auto-start a static file server (`npx serve out -l 3000`) before tests run, with `reuseExistingServer` for local dev convenience
- **`test-results/`**: Cleaned up stale error artifacts from failed runs
- **SelfAssessment email gate** (pre-existing uncommitted change): Confirmed working — all SelfAssessment tests pass with the new email capture feature

### Agents Involved
- product-manager — candidate generation
- system-architect — candidate generation
- qa-engineer — candidate generation
- growth-strategist — candidate generation
- coordinator — root cause analysis, implementation, validation

### Validation Results
- Build: ✅ All 27 routes compile successfully
- Tests: ✅ 54/54 Playwright tests pass (8.5s)
- Determinism: ✅ Tests now auto-start their own server — no manual setup required
- Regression: ✅ No regressions detected

### Outcome
Test infrastructure is now self-contained and deterministic. Running `npx playwright test` works from a cold start without any manual server setup. This eliminates the class of "stale server" failures permanently.
