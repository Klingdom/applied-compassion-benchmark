# ITERATION LOG — Compassion Benchmark

## Iteration 4 — 2026-04-30 (combined micro-loop, 4 items)

### Selected Items
Founder-authorized 4-item micro-loop (deviation from "1 item per loop" rule, explicit authorization):

1. **Backlog #4** — Single scoring formula module (architecture, score 15)
2. **Backlog #3** — EntitySearch routes to wrong page (UX, score 15)
3. **Backlog #2** — Ranking table instrumentation (analytics, score 16)
4. **Backlog #8** — Build-time data manifest (architecture, score 14)

### Reason for Selection
After consolidated review across 7 specialist agents (product-manager, system-architect, qa-engineer, frontend-engineer, backend-engineer, ux-designer, analytics) producing 32 candidates, founder selected this cluster for combined execution. Common thread: **strengthens determinism, traceability, and observability primitives that underpin all future work.** No item depends on another, so failure of any one would not block the others.

### What Changed

**#4 — Single scoring formula module**
- New: `site/scripts/lib/scoring.mjs` — canonical script-side composite formula, `getBand`, `BAND_ORDER`, `BAND_RANGES`, `DIMENSION_CODES`, `METHODOLOGY_VERSION`
- Modified: `site/scripts/validate-indexes.mjs` — imports from canonical module, eliminating ~30 duplicated lines of formula logic
- Modified: `site/scripts/test-scoring.mjs` — added 25 drift-gate tests (golden inputs, methodology version, dimension-codes parity)
- Validator output unchanged (12,747 checks pass identically)

**#3 — EntitySearch routes to wrong page**
- Modified: `site/src/components/index/EntitySearch.tsx`
  - Imports `entityHref` and `slugify` from canonical lib
  - Search results now route to `/{kind}/{slug}` (entity detail) instead of `/{indexSlug}` (index page)
  - Falls back to index page only when index has no detail route
  - Added `entity_search_result_click` analytics event with query + entity_name + target type

**#2 — Ranking table instrumentation**
- Modified: `site/src/components/index/RankingTable.tsx`
  - Added `KIND_TO_INDEX_SLUG` map (mirrors `entityHref.ts` for analytics symmetry)
  - 4 new events: `ranking_table_search` (debounced 800ms, ≥2 chars), `ranking_table_filter`, `ranking_table_sort`, `ranking_entity_click`
  - Each event carries `index_slug`, `entity_kind`, plus event-specific context (rank, composite, band for clicks; query_length for searches)

**#8 — Build-time data manifest**
- New: `site/scripts/build-manifest.mjs` — emits `public/build-manifest.json` (copied to `out/` by Next.js static export)
- Modified: `site/package.json` — `build` script now `node scripts/build-manifest.mjs && next build`; new `manifest` script for ad-hoc runs
- Manifest schema: `buildDate`, `git { sha, branch, dirty }`, `methodologyVersion`, per-index `{ rankingsCount, entityCount, hash (sha256), meanScore, medianScore, bands, floorDesignations }`, `totalEntities`, `totalFloorDesignations`, `recentAppliedProposals` (last 20)
- First build output: 7 indexes, 1,156 entities, 6 floor-designated, methodology v1.2

### Agents Involved
- product-manager, system-architect, qa-engineer, frontend-engineer, backend-engineer, ux-designer, analytics — candidate generation (parallel review)
- coordinator — synthesis, sequencing, implementation, validation

### Validation Results
- Build: ✅ Manifest generates → Next build → 1,203 pages prerendered (was 1,203, no regression)
- Tests: ✅ `npm run test:scoring` 69/69 passing (was 44; +25 drift-gate tests)
- Validator: ✅ `npm run validate` produces identical output (12,747 checks pass) — pure refactor confirmed
- Manifest: ✅ Written to `public/build-manifest.json`, copied to `out/build-manifest.json` during static export
- Determinism: ✅ Scoring formula now has single source of truth + drift-gate; reproducible build manifest captures full data-layer state

### Outcome
- **Determinism strengthened:** scoring formula deduplicated; drift-gate test added; methodology version centralized
- **Traceability strengthened:** every build now produces a hashed manifest of the data layer + recent applied proposals
- **Observability strengthened:** ranking-table interactions and entity-search clicks now measurable in Umami
- **User-facing bug fixed:** entity search results no longer dead-end on the index page

### Follow-ups
- (Pending) Surface manifest data in `/updates` page (read `/build-manifest.json` for cache-bust + entity-count assertions)
- (Pending) Wire `npm run validate` into `build` (Backlog #5, score 15) — would close the regression-class gap
- (Pending) Add Umami dashboard with `ranking_table_*` and `entity_search_result_click` events

## Iteration 1 — 2026-04-14

### Selected Item
Fix 4 failing interactive tests (Backlog #1, Score: 14)

### Reason for Selection
Tests are the foundation of the improvement loop. The system was in a degraded state with 4 failing tests, blocking reliable validation of all future changes. Determinism principle: restore the ability to prove correctness before adding anything new.

### Root Cause Analysis
The 4 test failures were NOT caused by code bugs. Root cause: Playwright config had no `webServer` directive, requiring a manually-started dev server on port 3000. A stale/crashed server was returning 500 errors, causing all interactive component tests to fail.

### What Changed
- **`playwright.config.ts`**: Added `webServer` config to auto-start a static file server (`npx serve out -l 3000`) before tests run, with `reuseExistingServer` for local dev convenience
- **`test-results/`**: Cleaned up stale error artifacts from failed runs
- **SelfAssessment email gate** (pre-existing uncommitted change): Confirmed working — all SelfAssessment tests pass with the new email capture feature

### Agents Involved
- product-manager — candidate generation
- system-architect — candidate generation
- qa-engineer — candidate generation
- growth-strategist — candidate generation
- coordinator — root cause analysis, implementation, validation

### Validation Results
- Build: ✅ All 27 routes compile successfully
- Tests: ✅ 54/54 Playwright tests pass (8.5s)
- Determinism: ✅ Tests now auto-start their own server — no manual setup required
- Regression: ✅ No regressions detected

### Outcome
Test infrastructure is now self-contained and deterministic. Running `npx playwright test` works from a cold start without any manual server setup. This eliminates the class of "stale server" failures permanently.

### Follow-ups
- Backlog #2: Fix hardcoded `/8` in SelfAssessment scoring (Score: 14)
- Backlog #3: Fix homepage stat inconsistencies (Score: 13)
- Backlog #4: Add conversion CTA to SelfAssessment results (Score: 13)

## Iteration 2 — 2026-04-14

### Selected Item
Fix all factual errors, broken links, and internal copy on public pages

### Reason for Selection
A benchmark institution publishing wrong numbers and internal planning notes destroys the core value proposition. Every specialist agent rated this as the #1 priority. Combined as one item because all fixes are the same class (wrong/unprofessional content) and each is a 1-2 line change.

### What Changed
- **Homepage (`page.tsx`)**: Fixed "780" → "1,155" entities, "5" → "7" index families, "AI Labs: 25" → "50", "five primary" → "seven", added missing title metadata
- **Indexes page (`indexes/page.tsx`)**: Fixed broken Gumroad link (string literal → variable reference), removed duplicate import, fixed "780" → "1,155", "5" → "7", "five" → "seven", replaced internal planning copy with user-facing text, fixed meta description
- **Purchase research (`purchase-research/page.tsx`)**: Fixed "5" → "7" index families
- **SelfAssessment (`SelfAssessment.tsx`)**: Replaced hardcoded `/8` with `DIMENSIONS.length` in calcScores()
- **Test (`home.spec.ts`)**: Updated entity count assertion from 780 to 1,155

### Agents Involved
- Explore agent — deep codebase audit (every file)
- ux-designer — UX flow audit and prioritization
- qa-engineer — bug triage and severity rating
- coordinator — verification, implementation, validation

### Validation Results
- Build: ✅ All 27 routes compile
- Tests: ✅ 54/54 pass
- Regression: ✅ None

### Outcome
All publicly visible factual errors are corrected. The broken Gumroad purchase link now works. Internal planning notes replaced with professional copy. Scoring formula is now dynamic.

### Follow-ups
- Add post-assessment CTA flow to SelfAssessment results
- Add keyboard accessibility to Navbar Tools dropdown
- Add aria-label to RankingTable search input
- Add missing Gumroad links for US States and US Cities

## Iteration 3 — 2026-04-16

### Selected Item
Add data integrity validation for all 7 index JSON files (Backlog #7, Score: 15)

### Reason for Selection
The overnight research pipeline now modifies production JSON data nightly — 3 files were changed in the first run. No validation existed to catch structural corruption, rank errors, or score-out-of-range issues. Pre-implementation check found **2 real issues**: us-states rank gaps and band count mismatch (both known data characteristics, now documented). Determinism and traceability principles: prove data correctness before every deploy.

### What Changed
- **`scripts/validate-indexes.mjs`** (new): Comprehensive validation script with 11 check categories:
  1. JSON parse integrity
  2. Meta field presence and types
  3. Required ranking fields per index (with index-specific field maps)
  4. All 8 dimension codes present in every entity
  5. Score ranges: raw 0-5, composite 0-100
  6. Rank contiguity (1..n, no gaps, no duplicates)
  7. meta.entityCount vs rankings.length consistency
  8. Band count sum vs entity count
  9. Band name/range validity
  10. Composite ≈ mean of scaled dimension scores (with legacy tolerance)
  11. Band assignment matches composite (with boundary tolerance)
- **`package.json`**: Added `npm run validate` script
- **Known data handling**: US States partial data (21/51) documented with `KNOWN_PARTIAL` config; legacy composite formula offset (up to ~5 points) handled with warning thresholds
- **Test fixes**: Fixed 4 pre-existing test failures from prior UI changes:
  - `home.spec.ts`: Updated 1,155 stat locator for Stat component
  - `navigation.spec.ts`: Updated for Indexes dropdown button and /updates link
  - `interactive.spec.ts`: Updated for Gumroad direct-purchase default path
  - `ranking-table.spec.ts`: Fixed sort test to find Score column by header position

### Agents Involved
- qa-engineer — candidate generation (testing/quality gaps)
- system-architect — candidate generation (architecture/data safety gaps)
- product-manager — candidate generation (product value/revenue gaps)
- coordinator — scoring, selection, implementation, validation

### Validation Results
- Build: ✅ All 27 routes compile
- Tests: ✅ 54/54 Playwright tests pass (10.8s)
- Data validation: ✅ 12,686 checks passed, 0 errors, 181 warnings
- Warnings: All 181 are documented legacy data characteristics (composite formula offset, band boundary ambiguity)
- Regression: ✅ None

### Outcome
Every index file is now validated with 11 categories of structural checks. The `npm run validate` command can be run before any deploy or after any pipeline modification. The validation correctly distinguishes between errors (would catch corruption) and warnings (documents known legacy characteristics). Four pre-existing test failures were also fixed, restoring full green test suite.

### Follow-ups
- Integrate `npm run validate` into deploy.sh as a pre-deploy gate
- Add validation as a CI step when CI pipeline is created
- Self-Assessment results CTA (Score: 15)
- Analytics instrumentation (Score: 15)
- JSON schema validation at build time (Score: 14)

## Revenue Cycle 1 — 2026-04-16

### Selected Item
Fix product cards on /purchase-research to route directly to Gumroad (Revenue Priority #1)

### Reason for Selection
The /purchase-research page is the primary purchase path. All 6 product cards routed to /contact-sales, forcing a sales conversation even for the $195 self-serve PDF product. The direct Gumroad checkout existed only inside the configurator widget — a secondary, less visible path. This is the highest-confidence revenue fix: remove friction from an existing purchase-intent path.

### What Changed
- **`purchase-research/page.tsx`**: Restructured product section into two tiers:
  - **Self-serve index reports**: 5 individual cards (Countries, Fortune 500, AI Labs, Robotics, Global Cities) each with direct Gumroad "Purchase — $195" button opening in new tab
  - **U.S. States & Cities card**: Request-based (no Gumroad product yet), routes to /contact-sales
  - **Premium products**: 5 cards (bundle, appendix, institutional, deck, custom) correctly route to /contact-sales with "Request quote" CTA
- **Cleaned internal copy**: Replaced planning language ("route buyers into the right purchase flow") with user-facing copy throughout
- **Before**: 0 Gumroad links from product cards | **After**: 5 direct Gumroad checkout buttons

### Agents Involved
- Explore agent — full revenue infrastructure audit (every file)
- growth-strategist — revenue improvement candidates
- coordinator — selection, implementation, validation

### Validation Results
- Build: ✅ All 27 routes compile
- Tests: ✅ 54/54 pass
- Data: ✅ 12,686 validation checks pass
- Gumroad verification: ✅ All 5 product URLs present in built output
- Regression: ✅ None

### Outcome
The purchase page now has a clear two-tier structure: instant-checkout products at $195 each (5 index reports) and premium products that correctly route to sales inquiry. The self-serve path is no longer hidden behind the configurator.

### Revenue Follow-ups (prioritized)
1. Add Gumroad products for U.S. States and U.S. Cities ($195 each) — requires creating listings on Gumroad
2. Newsletter/email capture on /updates and homepage — audience building for pipeline content
3. Analytics (Plausible) — enables conversion measurement for all paths
4. Separate Formspree form IDs (sales vs assessment) — data hygiene
